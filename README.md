# Sudoku

A Sudoku application written in Rust, supporting both desktop and web platforms.

## Project Goals

- **Automatic Puzzle Generation**: Generate Sudoku puzzles with configurable difficulty levels
- **Multiple Solving Strategies**: Implement both algorithmic (backtracking) and human-like solving techniques
- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop GUI and Web/WASM support using egui/eframe

## Current Status

- ✅ **sudoku-core**: Core data structures **implemented**
  - Type-safe grid containers and indexing (CandidateGrid, DigitGrid)
  - Basic types (Digit, Position) with semantic indexing

- ⚙️ **sudoku-solver**: Solver framework **implemented** (techniques: minimal)
  - Technique-based solver and backtracking solver
  - Current: basic techniques (Naked/Hidden Single)
  - TODO: Naked/Hidden Pairs, Pointing Pairs, Box/Line Reduction, X-Wing, etc.

- ✅ **sudoku-generator**: Puzzle generation **implemented**
  - Removal method with unique solution guarantee
  - Reproducible generation via seeds

- ⚙️ **sudoku-game**: Game logic **minimally implemented**
  - Game session management with basic operations
  - TODO: candidate marks, undo/redo, hints, save/load

- ⚙️ **sudoku-app**: GUI **minimally implemented**
  - 9x9 board rendering with 3x3 boundaries
  - Mouse selection and keyboard input
  - New game and solved status display
