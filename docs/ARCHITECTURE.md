# Sudoku Application Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the Sudoku application, including the crate structure, responsibilities, and dependencies.

## Project Goals

- **Problem Generation**: Automatically generate Sudoku puzzles with configurable difficulty levels
- **Multiple Solving Strategies**: Implement both algorithmic (backtracking) and human-like solving techniques
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Desktop GUI (egui/eframe) and Web (WASM)
- **Interactive Features**: Hints, mistake detection, undo/redo functionality

## Crate Descriptions

### sudoku-core

**Status**: Completed ✅

**Purpose**: Provides fundamental data structures and types for representing Sudoku puzzles.

**Key Components**:

- **Basic Types**: `Digit`, `Position` - Type-safe representations of sudoku elements
- **CandidateGrid**: Candidate tracking optimized for solving algorithms
- **DigitGrid**: Simple, intuitive cell-centric interface with string parsing/formatting
- **Generic Containers**: Efficient bitset and array implementations (`BitSet9`, `BitSet81`, `Array9`, `Array81`) with type-safe indexing

**Dependencies**: None

**Design Decisions**:

- **Two-Grid Architecture**: Separation of concerns between solving and simple data access
  - `CandidateGrid`: Digit-centric interface optimized for constraint propagation and solving algorithms
  - `DigitGrid`: Cell-centric interface for intuitive "what's in this cell?" queries
    - Uses `Array81<Option<Digit>, PositionSemantics>` for type-safe cell storage
    - Supports string parsing (`FromStr`) and formatting (`Display`)
    - Provides conversion to/from `CandidateGrid`
  - Allows each type to provide the most natural interface for its use case

- **Type Safety via Semantics**: Generic containers prevent mixing incompatible index types at compile time

- **Conversion Design**: One-way conversion from `DigitGrid` to `CandidateGrid` via `From` trait
  - `CandidateGrid` → `DigitGrid` is intentionally not provided as `From` to avoid lossy conversions
  - For extracting decided cells, use explicit methods when needed in higher-level crates

For implementation details, see the [crate documentation](../crates/sudoku-core/src/lib.rs).

### sudoku-solver

**Status**: Completed ✅

**Purpose**: Implements solving algorithms using technique-based approach with backtracking fallback.

**Key Components**:

- **`TechniqueSolver`**: Applies human-like solving techniques without backtracking
  - Step-by-step solving with progress tracking
  - Statistics collection (technique usage, step count)
  - Returns when stuck for difficulty evaluation
  
- **`BacktrackSolver`**: Combines techniques with backtracking
  - Uses `TechniqueSolver` first, backtracks when stuck
  - Enumerates all solutions (for puzzle validation)
  - Tracks assumptions and backtrack count

- **Extensible Technique System**: New solving techniques can be added by implementing the `Technique` trait

- **Progress Strategy**: Resets to first technique on any progress (cell placement or candidate removal)

**Dependencies**: `sudoku-core`

**Design Decisions**:

- **Two-layer architecture**: Separates technique-only solving from backtracking
  - Allows difficulty evaluation based on which techniques are needed
  - Useful for puzzle generation with specific technique requirements
  
- **Stateless techniques**: Each technique holds no state, only implements `apply()` method
  
- **Solution enumeration**: `BacktrackSolver::solve()` returns an iterator for finding multiple solutions

For detailed API documentation, see the [crate documentation](../crates/sudoku-solver/src/lib.rs).

### sudoku-generator

**Status**: Planned 📋

**Purpose**: Generates valid Sudoku puzzles with specified difficulty levels.

**Dependencies**: `sudoku-core`, `sudoku-solver`

---

### sudoku-game

**Status**: Planned 📋

**Purpose**: Manages game state, user interactions, and game logic.

**Dependencies**: `sudoku-core`, `sudoku-solver`, `sudoku-generator`

---

### sudoku-app

**Status**: Planned 📋

**Purpose**: GUI application for both desktop and web platforms using egui/eframe.

**Dependencies**: `sudoku-game`, `eframe`

## Dependency Graph

```text
sudoku-core
    ↓
sudoku-solver
    ↓
sudoku-generator
    ↓
sudoku-game
    ↓
sudoku-app (desktop + web)
```

**Principles**:

- Dependencies flow in one direction (no circular dependencies)
- Lower-level crates have no knowledge of higher-level crates
- Core data structures are independent and reusable
- UI implementations depend on game logic, not vice versa

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Two-Grid Architecture

**Decision**: Use separate types for solving (`CandidateGrid`) and data exchange (`DigitGrid`).

**Rationale**:

- Solving algorithms need fast candidate tracking and constraint propagation (digit-centric view)
- Simple data access needs intuitive "what's in this cell?" interface (cell-centric view)
- Each grid type can be optimized for its specific use case without compromise
- Clean separation prevents mixing solving logic with I/O concerns
- `DigitGrid` provides human-friendly string parsing/formatting for puzzle I/O

**Trade-offs**:

- Requires conversion between grid types (via `From`/`Into` traits)
- Two types to maintain instead of one
- Benefits: Better performance, cleaner API, easier to understand and test, natural interfaces for each use case

### Separation of Solver Techniques

**Decision**: Each solving technique is implemented as a separate module.

**Rationale**:

- Easy to add new techniques without modifying existing code
- Clear testing boundaries
- Difficulty evaluation based on technique complexity
- Hint system can explain which technique to use

---

## Testing Strategy

- Each crate has comprehensive unit tests
- Property-based testing for core data structures (proptest)
- Edge case coverage for all public APIs
