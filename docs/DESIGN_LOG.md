## Entries

- 2026-01-24: MVP GUI uses a 9x9 grid with visible 3x3 boundaries — simple, clear, and easy to extend.
- 2026-01-24: Keyboard input uses digit keys + arrows + delete/backspace — minimal UX with low implementation cost.
- 2026-01-24: Prioritize visibility highlights (row/column/box + same digit) and track digit tally as a backlog item — focus on immediate playability pain points.
- 2026-01-24: Highlight spec — row/column/box use a neutral tint (not necessarily warm); same digit uses a distinct cool tint; cool wins on overlap; apply same-digit highlight only when the selected cell contains a digit, tuned for dark theme readability.
- 2026-01-24: Number pad UI — 2x5 layout; digits centered; per-digit filled count in the top-right; counts show filled totals; Del clears selected cell — improves mouse-only input while surfacing progress.
- 2026-01-25: UI uses ViewModels and `Action` returns for input/interaction — keeps rendering decoupled from game logic and centralizes action application.
- 2026-01-25: Game exposes can_* helpers for action gating — reduces UI-side rule checks.
- 2026-01-25: Always show the New Game confirmation dialog, even when the puzzle is solved — consistent UX and prevents accidental reset.
- 2026-01-26: Persist app state via eframe storage with RON serialization and DTO/try-from conversions — safe restoration with failure fallback to defaults and periodic + action-triggered saves.
