# Workflow

This project uses a lightweight, memory-friendly workflow for hobby development.

## 1) Capture ideas

- Add ideas or tasks to `docs/BACKLOG.md`
- Order does not matter

## 2) Record decisions

- When you decide something, add a short entry to `docs/DESIGN_LOG.md`
- Keep it to 1–3 short lines: what was decided and why
- If a decision needs more detail, write a brief note in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or create `docs/design/<topic>.md` and link it from the log

## 3) Implement

- Start coding once the scope is clear
- If scope changes, log the decision
- If UI inputs (keybinds or buttons) change, update README Controls

## 4) Mark done

- Mark completed backlog items with `[x]` in the task list

## Files to know

- `docs/BACKLOG.md`: ideas and tasks
- `docs/DESIGN_LOG.md`: decision history
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: long-term structure and design
- `docs/TESTING.md`: testing guidelines
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`: documentation conventions
