# TODO

This file tracks tasks that must be done to achieve the project goals.

**Workflow**: For each component, create a design document first. Based on the design, add specific implementation tasks to this TODO. On completion, delete the design document and preserve only essential design decisions in crate documentation or ARCHITECTURE.md.
